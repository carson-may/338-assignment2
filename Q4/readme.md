# Linked lists & Arrays

## Questions:

### Compare advantages and disadvantages of arrays vs linked list (complexity of task completion)

A large advantage of linked lists is resizability. In many languages, the sizes of arrays cannot change;
however, this is not true in python. Arrays in python are dynamic, but are inefficient when memory relocation
is necessary to increase the size. Linked lists do not hold this burden; consequently, they are optimal when
the desired size of an array is unknown. 
Arrays are advantageous when
