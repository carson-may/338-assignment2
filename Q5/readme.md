# Question 5
## Stacks and Queues are a special form of linked lists with some modifications that makes
## operation better. For parts 1 and 2 assume we are using a singly linked lis
## Part 1. In stacks, insertion (push) adds the newly inserted data at head
a. why? (0.5 pts)
b. Can we insert data at the end of the linked list? (0.5 pts)
c. If yes, then what is the difference in operation time (if any) for pushing and
popping data from the stack? (1 pt)
## Part 2. In Queues, we added a new pointer that points to the tail of the linked list
a. why? (0.5 pts)
b. Can we implement the Queue without the tail? (0.5 pts)
c. If yes, then what is the difference in operation time (if any) for enqueuing and
dequeuing data from the stack? (1 pt)
d. Can we change the behavior of the enqueue and dequeue where we enqueue at
head and dequeue at tai? Do you think it is a good idea? (1 pt)
## Part 3.Revisit your answers for part 1 and 2 but now with the assumption that we are using
## circular doubly linked list (5 pts
